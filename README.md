# Post App

Post App is an App that allow user access news from the foreign scene. 
It was developed using the following stacks:

- React Native (Expo)
- Redux (State Management)
- React Native Paper (UI)

Feel free to play around it here:

``
    git clone https://github.com/Temiogundeji/Gokada-Task.git
``

Then, Navigate to the root directory of the app

``
cd Gokada-Task
``

Install all dependencies

``
npm install
``

> Whoaa You're good to go

This App was built in response to the Task given to me.
